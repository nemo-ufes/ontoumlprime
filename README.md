ontoumlprime
============

This repository is maintained here for archival purposes only. It was the result of an experiment to refactor the OntoUML metamodel. Do not reuse as is. For current implementations of the OntoUML metamodel and serialization formats, see: <https://github.com/ontoUML/>

The purpose of this is to reimplement a metamodel for OntoUML that is independent of the UML. 
The previous OntoUML metamodel implementation by Carraretto was based on the UML 2.0 implementation
in Eclipse. This means that it is too polluted with UML constraints. Strictly speaking this is not 
UML anymore (so OntoUMLPrime is strictly speaking a misnomer). 
 
We have used the Xcore syntax. If you want to export a genmodel and ecore model from it, this can be done by following the steps in:
http://wiki.eclipse.org/Xcore#Converting_an_Xcore_Model_to_a_GenModel
This is not necessary if you just want to create dynamic instances of the model, and if you want to generate code, as it is generated
automatically when you save the xcore file. However, this is necessary to use the OCL constraints in ontoumlprime.ocl, as that refers
to the ecore and not the xcore file, and also to use tools that depend on ecore (diagramming tool, xtext). 
 
If you create a genmodel/ecore, make sure you do not generate code from the genmodel. The code is already produced at src-gen
when the xcore file is saved.

Instructions
